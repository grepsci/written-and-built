summary: One day or day one? Day one. I'm Collin and I am starting my journey to build publicly.

Beginning this was something I privately wrestled with especially weighing both the practicality and the trepidation of building publicly. I spent months doomscrolling on Twitter imagining one day I could follow in some of the incredible builders' footsteps out there.

Today might be the day I put pen to paper, but doesn't make it any easier. Writing this also allowed me to reflect on the amazing time we live in where knowledge has never been so accessible. I hope this journey will be fractionally as fruitful as the many incredible builders and individuals that have already done this, and have not only inspired, but also graciously shared their own journey publicly.

Anyway, where was I? I'm Collin. I've been a software engineer for over eight years and although building a sustainable startup has been elusive and more dream than reality in the past, it has taken me a while to decide if it was worth trying something new (this).

Perhaps this will be my best attempt yet. If there is a remedy for the uncertainty of not knowing what you're doing, I haven't found any yet. Nonetheless, I am here to document the journey regardless of outcome. If nothing else, it can serve as a reminder and resource for the many lessons eventually (and hopefully) learned along the way.

To kick this along, I've decided to revive an idea that I've worked on in the past, but will switch up the technology stack a bit. In subsequent posts, I hope to share some of the thoughts behind the idea and also the stack that I am settling on.

Follow [me](https://twitter.com/grepsc1) on this journey. Drop your email for updates! It'd be awesome to hear from many of you as I imagine the journey at times can be a lonely one.

Special thanks to [Sahil Bloom](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom), [Jon Yongfook](https://twitter.com/yongfook) and many many others that build publicy. I stand on the shoulder of giants. LFG.
